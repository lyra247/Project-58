        Hi!

        Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990)is an English actress, model, and activist. She has gained recognition for her roles in both blockbusters and independent films, as well as her women's rights work. Watson has been ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses by Forbes and Vanity Fair, and was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2015.
            <br>
            Born in Paris and raised in Oxfordshire, Watson attended the Dragon School and trained in acting at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. As a child, she rose to stardom after landing her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously. Watson also starred in the 2007 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and lent her voice to The Tale of Despereaux (2008). After the final Harry Potter film, she took on a supporting role in My Week with Marilyn (2011), before starring in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) opposite Logan Lerman and The Bling Ring (2013) alongside an ensemble cast, both to critical acclaim. In 2014, Watson played the titular character's adoptive daughter in the biblical epic Noah and was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning British Artist of the Year. She starred as Belle in the musical romantic fantasy Beauty and the Beast (2017), which ranks among the highest-grossing films of all time, and Meg March in the coming-of-age drama Little Women (2019), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Other notable film roles include This Is the End (2013), Regression, Colonia (both 2015), and The Circle (2017).

    <h2>I have acted as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter</h2>
     <h3>
      Hermione’s character develops significantly over the course of the story and sheds light on Harry’s character as well. At the outset, she is an annoying perfectionist, a goody-two-shoes who has read all the books for her classes in advance, has learned all about Hogwarts, and never breaks the rules. When she first speaks to Harry on the train ride to school, she is eager to impress him with her knowledge, whereas Harry only wants to make friends. Her intellectual talents are indeed worthy of pride, as we find out later when she scores 112 percent on her final exam. But we sense that her show-off side is a defense against her feelings of inferiority, because she comes from a Muggle family and, like Harry, is unfamiliar with the wizard world. In both Hermione and Harry we see that learning wizardry requires a great deal of social adjustment and self-confidence.

    <h2>I have acted as Belle from Beuty and the Beast</h2>
     <h3>
   Belle is the heroine in Disney's 2017's film, Beauty and the Beast. She is portrayed by Emma Watson. In this version, Belle is not only a bookworm but also an inventor -- she uses her inventions for everyday chores such as laundry, which in turn provides her with time to catch up on her reading.
